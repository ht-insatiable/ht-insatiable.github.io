<p><strong>Title:</strong> SUPA (Space, Universe, Particle, Atom)</p>
<p><strong>Artists:</strong> Tolo ZHANG, LIU Yuran, LUO Yilin</p>
<h4 id="Paragraphs"><a href="#Paragraphs" class="headerlink" title="Paragraphs:"></a>Paragraphs:</h4><p>We are inspired by the Big Bang theory, which accounts for the expansion of the Universe, and the White hole theory, which considers the White hole as a place releasing matter spontaneously into the Universe.</p>
<p>Demonstrated in the Big Bang Theory, the universe originated from a singularity. In SUPA, a new cosmic system containing a vortex is set, from the centre of which comes tons of planets randomly and continuously. Each planet is generated in the system with original speed and life. The speed of planets determines their moving patterns. The life of planets determines when they explode. In this way, the new universe consisting of a vortex and thousands of planets with their particles is gradually created.</p>
<p>We are inspired by the Big Bang theory, which accounts for the expansion of the Universe, and the White hole theory, which considers the White hole as a place releasing matter spontaneously into the Universe.</p>
<p>Demonstrated in the Big Bang Theory, the universe originated from a singularity. In SUPA, a new cosmic system containing a vortex is set, from the centre of which comes tons of planets randomly and continuously. Each planet is generated in the system with original speed and life. The speed of planets determines their moving patterns. The life of planets determines when they explode. In this way, the new universe consisting of a vortex and thousands of planets with their particles is gradually created.</p>
<p>We want to make SUPA in a 2D oil painting style. We intend to make things more abstract and comic so that the audience can understand our idea behind when interacting with SUPA, but others will not figure out what is SUPA talking about just through a glance at the final output. In this way, we will create an enjoyable and relaxed atmosphere, where all the small planets will be drew in the shape of simple and minimal ellipses with bright and happy colours.</p>
<p>The main colours we chose are those which we think match the pleasant atmosphere and can best represent the diversity and variability of the universe. Thus we decided to use dramatic blue, light orange and the very energetic red as the main colours with various proportion, shown as below,<br><img src="/images/SUPA/1.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Process"><a href="#Process" class="headerlink" title="Process:"></a>Process:</h4><p>In SUPA, we defined 3 classes in the p5.js: class Vortex, class Planet, class Particle.<br>We set the background colour to black with an opacity of (20/255). It aims to make moving elements have mobility of fresco, also like oil paintings.</p>
<h4 id="Screenshots"><a href="#Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="Screenshots:"></a>Screenshots:</h4><p><img src="/images/SUPA/2.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/SUPA/3.png" alt=""><br><img src="/images/SUPA/4.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="Work"><a href="#Work" class="headerlink" title="Work:"></a>Work:</h4><p>Click <a href="/SUPA">HERE</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Further-Development"><a href="#Further-Development" class="headerlink" title="Further Development:"></a>Further Development:</h4><p>Instead of simply clicking the mouse and watching the generating process of planets, we want the audience to be more engaged and have a deeper understanding of the universe through the interaction. Therefroe, we came up with an idea to make it to be a kind of  installation work which can help the audience have more reflections on the universe.</p>
<p>The universe gives birth to planets. The life happens on the planet. So-called ?Intelligent creatures? began to simulate the cosmic system model digitally. In the simulative system universe also gives birth to planets?Here seems to have a loop in a loop.</p>
<p>After human beings? constant exploration of the universe, lots of hypothesis have seemingly proved that the universe is vast beyond imagination. In the universe, the life of different planets seemed to be transient… It seems to be even less worth mentioning our lives.</p>
<p>Many of the assumptions about the universe seem small and shallow compared with the vastness of the unknown in the universe. However, computer systems, which was created by humans, can show and observe our imaginary universe system as humans? wishes. When SUPA is in a smaller cube, the universe seemingly appears to be controllable and belongs to the human self.<br><img src="/images/SUPA/5.png" alt=""><br>So we create a “secret cube” for the audience to experience the vastness of the universe.  When combined with SUPA, the whole scene become three-dimansional, where we can more directly get the audience invovled and and demonstrate the developing process of the universe. In front of the cube, the audience see the creation of this simulative cosmic system via digital media.</p>
<p>We intend to use mirror and projector to create an infinite space. When the audience look into the cube, they will feel like they are surrounded by the fantastic, unpredictable and mysterious universe.<br><img src="/images/SUPA/6.png" alt=""><br>We first tried handwriting the big bang theory and some other assumptions of the origin of the universe. Then we found that it’s a bit chaotic, so we tried laser cut to see if it will be better.<br><img src="/images/SUPA/7.png" alt=""></p>
